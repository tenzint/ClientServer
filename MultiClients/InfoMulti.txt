---------------------

Client needs to provide a unique ID (name is the ID in this project) to server. 
Server saves the name in a list.
Client then freely sends messages while simultaneously receiving messages from other clients
# client.java is done
Server receives messages from the client, and echoes it to every client in the list
# server.java is done
